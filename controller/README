To test:

    - Start the controller:
        python controller.py

    - Then start the Palette Agent:
        python agent.py

        By default, it will identify itself as:
            agent hostname: one
            agent type: primary
            agent_ip: 1.2.3.4

        You can start a additional agents and the command-line
        arguments to have the additional agent identify itself
        differently:
            usage: agent hostname {primary|worker|other} ip-address

        For example:
             python agent.py my-hostname worker 192.168.1.5

    - Then telnet to the controller:
        telnet localhost 9000

      and enter some commands:
        status

        cli dir
            Sends the 'dir' command to run and retrieves the results
            and status.

        copy source-hostname source-path target-hostname target-path
            Sends the command to copy file 'source-path' from 'source-hostname'
            to a file named 'target-path' on host 'target-hostname'.

        backup

        restore

        restore [source-hostname]:pathname
            If the specified file is not on the primary agent, then it
            will be copied to the primary before doing the restore.
