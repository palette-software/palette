Linux:
    Dependencies:
    =============
        sudo apt-get install postgresql python-sqlalchemy python-psycopg2
        

    If you want to test alerts via email:
        sudo apt-get install postfix

    and when asked about postfix configuration, respond any way you want,
    as you configure the Postfix mail server as super-user via:

        Copy the main.cf file to /etc/postfix and then restart postfix:
            service postfix restart

    Configure email alert enabled/to/from/etc. in inits.py
    BY DEFAULT, ALERTS ARE OFF.

    postgres configuration
    =======================
        sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER
        sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser palette
        sudo -u postgres createdb paldb

        Set the password for palette:
            sudo -u postgres psql
            postgres=# \password palette
            Enter new password: palpass
            Enter it again:
            postgres=# \quit

To test:
========

    - Get a usable INI file
        cp DEBIAN/etc/controller.ini .

    - Start the controller:
        python controller/controller.py controller.ini

    - Then start the Palette Agent:
        python agent.py

        By default, it will identify itself as:
            agent hostname: one
            agent type: primary
            agent_ip: 1.2.3.4

        You can start a additional agents and the command-line
        arguments to have the additional agent identify itself
        differently:
            usage: agent hostname {primary|worker|other} ip-address

        For example:
             python agent.py my-hostname worker 192.168.1.5

    - Then telnet to the controller:
        telnet localhost 9000

      and enter some commands:
        status

        cli dir
            Sends the 'dir' command to run and retrieves the results
            and status.

        copy source-hostname source-path target-hostname target-path
            Sends the command to copy file 'source-path' from 'source-hostname'
            to a file named 'target-path' on host 'target-hostname'.

        backup

        restore

        restore [source-hostname]:pathname
            If the specified file is not on the primary agent, then it
            will be copied to the primary before doing the restore.

The SSL certificate was created with this command:

    $ cd controller/DEBIAN/etc
    $ openssl req -new -x509 -days 730 -nodes -out palette_cert.pem -keyout palette_cert.pem
    Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
    ..............++++++
    ..++++++
    writing new private key to 'palette_cert.pem'

    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
    into your certificate request.
    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
    For some fields there will be a default value,
    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

    Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
    State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:CA
    Locality Name (eg, city) []:San Francisco
    Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Palette Software
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
    Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:palette-software.com
    Email Address []:hostmaster@palette-software.com

The above created the file:
    palette_cert.pem
