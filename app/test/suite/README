This test suite runs only with Firefox.
You must first add the Selenium IDE Firefox plugin:

    Navigate to:
        http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/

    Scroll down to "Selenium IDE"
            "Selenium IDE is a Firefox plugin which records and plays back
            user interactions with the browser. Use this to either create
            simple scripts or assist in exploratory testing. It can also
            export Remote Control or WebDriver scripts, though they tend
            to be somewhat brittle and should be overhauled into some
            sort of Page Object-y structure for any kind of resiliency."

    Download the latest reeleased version (currently 2.9.0).

    Firefox will protect you from installing addons from unfamiliar
    locations, so you will need to click ‘Allow’ to proceed with
    the installation...

Start the Selenium IDE by clicking on the Firefox menu:
    Tools-->Selenium IDE

Load the test suite:
    File-->Open Test Suite

        palette/app/test/suite/.../testsuite

At the top of the Selenium IDE, set the "Base URL" to the URL of
your Palette test URL.

Configure the tableau administrator username and password by clicking on:
    Enable Archives (left pane)
    type id=archive-username ...
        change the Value at the bottom

    type id=archive-password
        change the Value at the bottom

Click on the furthest left green button ("Play entire test suite").

Notes:
    There will be failures.
    Some of the failures are due to unexpected alerts.

    You can slow down the speed of the test near the upper-left corner
    which reduces failures.
