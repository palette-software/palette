Selenium Setup

Install the Python bindings for the Selenium WebDriver:

    sudo pip install -U selenium

Install the Chrome driver:

    From the Selenium download page:

        http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/

    download the Chrome driver, and place it somewhere your path, for example:

        ~/bin/chromedriver

Selenium Standalone Server (future)

    Optionally, also download the standalone server from the Selenium download page. This is a Java (.jar) application. The standalone server is not needed if the test scripts are launched on the system running the browser. In the future we may drive browsers remotely.
