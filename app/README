If you have not installed the "palette" Debian package, and you want
to run httpserver with the development code:

    Make sure you are in the palette/app directory.

    cp DEBIAN/etc/palette.ini .

    Change the "plugins" line:
        #plugins = /opt/palette/plugins
        plugins = %(here)s/plugins

    Pass the ini file on the command line:
        httpserver palette.ini
